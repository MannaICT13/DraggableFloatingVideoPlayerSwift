# Draggable and Floating Video Player Swift
#### I've developed a Swift floating/draggable player inspired by YouTube's functionality, which persists atop all screens until manually dismissed. It's built upon the foundation of [PlayerView](https://github.com/davidlondono/PlayerView) and [DraggableYoutubeFloatingVideo](https://github.com/vizllx/DraggableYoutubeFloatingVideo), offering a seamless and engaging multimedia experience.
